Acts as a transcriptional repressor via its interaction with EBF1, a transcription factor involved in terminal olfactory receptor neurons differentiation; this interaction preventing EBF1 to bind DNA and activate olfactory-specific genes. Involved in olfactory neurogenesis by participating in a developmenta [...] 
9606.ENSP00000469689	SHANK2	1849	SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 2; Seems to be an adapter protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses that interconnects receptors of the postsynaptic membrane including NMDA-type and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and the actin-based cytoskeleton. May play a role in the structural and functional organization of the dendritic spine and synaptic junction; Belongs to the SHANK family
9606.ENSP00000479618	MYC	454	Myc proto-oncogene protein; Transcription factor that binds DNA in a non-specific manner, yet also specifically recognizes the core sequence 5'- CAC[GA]TG-3'. Activates the transcription of growth-related genes. Binds to the VEGFA promoter, promoting VEGFA production and subsequent sprouting angiogenesis; Basic helix-loop-helix proteins
